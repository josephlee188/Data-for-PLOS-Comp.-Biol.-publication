## Paper title : Neighbor-enhanced cell motility in dense cell populations

Trajectories of MDA-MB-231 cells within confleuent population (n = 258), freely crawling cells (n = 187), rotating doublets (n = 57), and cell-quadruplets (n = 40). 

Trajectories of cells simulated with CPM at fixed parameters (details were provided in the manuscript) were also provided; those within confluent population, freely crawling cells, cell-doublets, and cell-quadruplets. All cells were simulated 200 different times with varying random seed.

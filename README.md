MATLAB .mat files are for the trajectories of MDA-MB-231 cells, and the simulated cells. The .m files contain analysis codes for the paper. 

The simulations in this paper were done via open-source platform for multi-cellular simulation "Morpheus" (https://morpheus.gitlab.io/).

The xml file contains all the parameters for the simulations performed via Morpheus.

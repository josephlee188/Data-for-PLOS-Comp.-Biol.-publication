Experimental and simulated cells' trajectories for publication in PLOS Computational Biology

Trajectories of MDA-MB-231 cells within confleuent population (n = 258), freely crawling cells (n = 187), rotating forming doublets (n = 57), in cell-quadruplets (n = 40). 

Trajectories of cells simulated with CPM at fixed parameters (details were provided in the manuscript) were also provided; those within confluent population, freely crawling 

cells, cell-doublets, and cell-quadruplets. All cells were simulated 200 different times with varying random seed.
